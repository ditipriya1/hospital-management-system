# hospital-management-system
Analyzed a mock hospital database using SQL and visualized insights in Power BI. Explored physician affiliations, nurse roles, prescription trends, and high-cost procedures. The project simulates how data can support staffing, budgeting, and operational decisions in a hospital setting.

# 🏥 Hospital Operations Analysis – SQL & Power BI

This project simulates how **SQL** and **Power BI** can be used to uncover operational insights from a hospital's internal data.  
Using a mock database modeled on a real-world schema, I explored various aspects of hospital performance — from staffing to prescriptions.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze staff roles, department affiliations, and workload distribution  
- Identify diagnosis and prescription trends  
- Segment procedures by cost to uncover budgeting opportunities  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for operational improvement

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL**: Data retrieval, joins, filtering, and aggregations  
- **Power BI**: Visual dashboards for stakeholder-friendly insights

## 🗃️ Dataset

This project uses a **mock hospital management schema** sourced from a public GitHub repository.

Key tables included:
- `Physician`
- `Department`
- `Nurse`
- `Patient`
- `Patient_Diagnosis`

## 📊 Key Insights

- Most common diagnoses: **Anxiety Disorder** and **Chronic Pain**  
- Prescription trends showed 5 medications dominated treatment patterns  
- High-cost procedures ($3000+) accounted for **~40%** of all procedures  
- **Neurology** and **Cardiology** had the most physician affiliations  
- Majority of registered nurses were in the **Head Nurse** position

## ✅ Business Recommendations

- Align nurse availability with department workload, especially in high-demand areas  
- Reassess high-cost procedures for pricing optimization or clinical justification  
- Review frequently prescribed medications for cost-effectiveness and outcome alignment  
- Use diagnosis trends to guide **resource allocation** and **equipment planning**
